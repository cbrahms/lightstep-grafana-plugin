# LightStep Datasource

Once you install the LightStep Datasource plugin, you should be able to add LightStep graphs into your Grafana dashboards.

We are currently alpha testing this plugin.

The current supported version of grafana is 4.6.x

After installing the plugin (see [Installing Plugins](http://docs.grafana.org/plugins/installation/)), you will need to reach out to your LightStep representative to enable your account for alpha access and generate the API key needed in the configuration screen.

Follow the configuration screen instructions to configure the plugin.
